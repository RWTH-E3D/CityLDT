The City-LoD-Transformation-Tool (CityLDT) aims to easily scale CityGML models between differing Levels of Detail (LoD).
The main focus is to enrich lower level buildings to a higher level of detail with user entered data; reducing complexety is also envisioned.
This tool was developed for Python 3.5+ using PySide2. A detailed list of the required libraries can be found in the readme.
